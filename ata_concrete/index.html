                <h2>Meet the Owner</h2>
                <p>Rich grew up in the bay area going to local schools in Oakland. While his friends were spending their summers camping and traveling, Rich stayed behind and helped his dad and uncles construct concrete projects. He grew a liking for the craft and willingly welcomed the challenges and problem-solving the work presented. He learned the value of hard work and sacrifice. When asked why concrete? His answer is, “I like taking people’s visions and bringing it to life, step by step.”</p>
