        Hello. My name is Tary. I am currently a stay-at-home mom and an online student. My kids are ages 3, 6, and 8. Being a mom is such a blessing.
        I have experienced my most saddest moments as well as my greatest of joys in motherhood. However, I know that eventually my little birds will grow up
        and leave the nest. Because of this, I do have a desire to earn a degree and hopefully a career one day.

        I completed BYU-Pathway and have been taking my time just working on my generals. I had a hard time choosing a major. I believe I've gone through 3 already.
        I finally decided that I want to earn a BS in Software Development. At first, I thought that a business degree might be the most beneficial for me since my 
        husband and I co-own a small concrete business. However, after taking a few business courses, (I'm grateful for the knowledge), but realized that the job did 
        not fit my personality and lifestyle. Then, I thought I would go into accounting being that I was computer-savvy and loved working with numbers. I liked the 
        problem-solving that came with working with numbers and building excel sheets. Still, that wasn't quite the route for me neither. Finally, I found that Software Development was more of what I could see myself 
        doing long-term. I downloaded some coding apps and practiced a little bit and fell in love with the concept of building software.

        My education has been a long journey and I'm only halfway through my degree program. More than gaining a career, I've come to know that I just love to learn.
        I would consider myself a rennaisance person. One of my favorite things to study is the creation. I love hearing different creation stories from all parts
        and cultures of the world. Many of them are actually very similar to one another. My favorite of course, stems from my own Tongan roots.

        Of all the things I study, the most intriguing will always be the scriptures. It's filled with so many connections and themes that are both fascinating and
        spiritual. The gospel of Jesus Christ has been a huge anchor during some very stormy times in my life. If ever I have doubts, I turn to
        the knowledge that there is a Father in Heaven who loves me and watches over me. He gave the world His Son to show us the way. He restored His church on earth
        once again after a great apostasy. He speaks to us through living prophets today. I find comfort knowing that I can be with my family forever.
